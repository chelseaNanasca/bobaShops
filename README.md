# bobaShops
This is a repository of my coding that I did in Posit Cloud using the programming language R, about boba shops.

I visualized average boba prices, boba price range, and used geocode to plot boba locations for a case study on local boba shops.

Here is a link to a demonstration of my code on Youtube: https://youtu.be/Hs04dlQ4jyc
